# SPIN-PromelaRTEMSTestGen
SPIN/Promela based test generation framework for RTEMS Barrier Manager

Jerzy Jaskuc

This repository contains all of the necessary files needed to perform test generation for [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/ "RTEMS Homepage") [Barrier Manager](https://docs.rtems.org/branches/master/c-user/barrier/background.html "Barrier Manager") using SPIN/Promela framework.

These files were produced as a part of my research work done in Trinity College Dublin in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MCS in Integrated Computer Science.

## Copyright Note
Spin2Test testgen tool included under testgen-src was not produced by me during the project, but it is needed during the test generation process.
