# SPIN-PromelaTestGeneration

Eoin Lynch

This repo contains the code for the generation/running of tests for the RTEMS Message Manager,
https://docs.rtems.org/branches/master/c-user/message/index.html

This project is research work done for my dissertation as part of the MAI in Computer Engineering program at Trinity College Dublin

This project requires the spin2test and testbuilder projects to generate tests. These are located in testgen-src. Not created by me
